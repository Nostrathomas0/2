  <h1>Drops get *****/5 stars</h1>
<p>If you love to drag and drop, this app might match your digital asthetic. The features that it supports
are very neat and well designed. It mixes audio samples with some fantastically designed visual stimuli which is perfect for learning the
radicals of Chinese characters/p> by drawing them over pictures of what they represent. It's really quite a fantastic way to learn beginner
Chinese that unites phonological, visual and muscle memory.</p>

<p>Drops uses spaced repetition sequencing to help with vocab but with neither speech recognition nor lengthy passages, it's far from 
comprehensive. It's basically a lite, fun word memorization aid. Ads are light and you won't run into walls on the free version for a few 
weeks of use unless you want to use it a lot. The first use restricts you to 5 minutes a day but as you play, you win additional time. The
ads, are  10 hour wait time between 5 minute lessons, access to word bank. Lots of locked content is enticing.</p>

<p>Make it work for you by supplimenting it with a grammar, speaking and pronunciation practice and reading and wrting activies. Use it for a
few minutes a day with deep focus to boost your vocabulary.</p>
