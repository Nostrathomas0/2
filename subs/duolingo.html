Duolingo is a free app (with minimal ads) that encodes language items with heavy focus on chunking. This is useful for some tricky
nuances of languages like French word-final irregularities. Flashcards are thrown out in favor of multiple guess. Facile memory 
encoding is blended with recall which gamifies the entire experience. n/
Spaced Repitition Systems record your mistakes on a lesson but questions are typically repeated so frequently that multiple n/
errors are rare. Grammar is taught implicitly as questions alternate between L1-L2 pairs, ear training, sentence translation and
voice recognition. 

The program asks two or three lessons a day (5 minutes) minimum to keep up a streak and receive seratonin candy. Other gamified 
elements include, power-ups, different kinds of in-game currancies, badges, unlockables, gambles, and bonus skills 
as well as a high score screen. In addition to the hundreds of 2-minute lessons, Duolingo also features short stories, leagues,
friends and a large group of active users.

Promoted claims that 34 hours of Duolingo are equal to a semester of university language courses comes from a study by  with 
volunteers language learners and funded by Duolingo. Levels are broken down into lexical and situational units of 5 lessons. 
  
Spaced repitition makes for a slow, thourough gain.

		hopefulprotolinguist said, "It's good for vocab, and for basic sentence practice, but not for grammar."
		IvanPetrovich1898 agreed and said, "Duolingo gets very tedious an repetitive after a pretty short period of time."
