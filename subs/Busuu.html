<h1>Busuu get ****/5 stars</h1>
<p>Have you ever used a language text book? If your favorite part of the coursebook was the instructions, than Busuu's good for you. Busuu 
  has some nice dialogues with audio files. It also has a voice recognition technology and I put it ot the test. The app and I were doing 
  French together and it was judging my pronunciation for "Ã§a va" /sava/. I said something like /kava/, which it instantly rejected. It 
  passed that bar but you'd be surprised how VRT lets wrong pronunciation through.</p>
  <p>Presentation and app aesthetics give you a lot of clear questions like, "what do you say to ask someone your name?" here's a tip "Memorize the word(s) and listen to the example."</p>
  <p>Busuu has good, clear audio, and the gap fill activities aren't too easy. Add that to the pretty sharp speech recognition software and
    that makes a pretty good tool to acquire speaking skills.</p>
